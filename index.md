## Special Features of the Gokul Gardens
  
  >* Gokul Garden enjoys the view of large open farm lands on the eastern and northern side and the beautiful Nilgiris hills on the western side.

>* Avenue flowering trees like Gulmohar, Cordia, Yellow shower etc have been planted along the entire drive way and supported by drip irrigation. Besides this we have established a 10 height Cassurina hedge with about 3700 saplings to make up the western boundary. This hedge today has established itself as a 10 feet tall green screen.

>* Rain Water Harvesting has been planned along the entire 1800 odd feet - 40 wide drive way. This will not only improve the ground water charge, but will also help our bore well. The entire layout is VASTU complaint.

  ## Roads
  
  >* 40' wide main road with 23'& 30' supporting roads leading to the plots. The roads are metal topped and have gradual taper to avoid water stagnation.

## Park

>* The entire eastern boundary has a park spread over one acre. This will ensure oxygen supply to the whole layout rather than being confined to a few pockets.
Storm Water + waste water drain are built keeping rugged use in mind.

## Approval

>* Land has undergone conversion from agricultural to residential status by the Housing Department at Chennai and Local Planning Authority, Coimbatore.
